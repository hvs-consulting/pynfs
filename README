This tree includes support for both 4.0 and 4.1 pynfs testing.  It is
the merge of what were originally two independent projects--initially
the 4.0 pynfs code was all moved into the nfs4.0 directory, but as time
passes we expect to merge the two code bases.

Install dependent modules:

* Debian
	apt-get install libkrb5-dev python3-dev swig python3-gssapi python3-ply

* Fedora
	yum install krb5-devel python3-devel swig python3-gssapi python3-ply

* openSUSE
	zypper install krb5-devel python3-devel swig python3-gssapi python3-ply

Your distro may provide the xdrlib3 module via a pkg (e.g. Debian
python3-standard-xdrlib) or you may install it via pip:

	pip install xdrlib3

If xdrlib3 is not available, the code will try to fallback to old xdrlib
(useful for python < 3.13).


You can prepare both versions for use with

	./setup.py build

which will create auto-generated files and compile any shared libraries
in place.

For more details about 4.0 and 4.1 testing, see nfs4.0/README and
nfs4.1/README, respectively.  For information about automatic code
generation from an XDR file, see xdr/README.

Note that any server under test must permit connections from high port
numbers.  (In the case of the Linux NFS server, you can do this by
adding "insecure" to the export options.)

Note that test results should *not* be considered authoritative
statements about the protocol--if you find that a server fails a test,
you should consult the rfc's and think carefully before assuming that
the server is at fault.  (However, we do appreciate patches if you find
a test that requires incorrect behavior.)
